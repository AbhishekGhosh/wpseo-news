Create a `wordpress-seo-modules` folder within your plugins directory. Copy the `wpseo-news` directory into that directory. Go into the SEO admin section and enable the XML News Sitemap feature that should now be showing up on your Dashboard.

Make sure you have the [WordPress SEO Plugin](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/) active and have enabled XML Sitemaps, otherwise it won't work.
